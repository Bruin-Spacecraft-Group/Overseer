The goal for this project is to learn about file I/O and data processing.
Your task is to edit wildfire_extraction.py so that it reads the data from California_Fire_Incidents.csv,
finds which fires are within a 1 degree radius of Tahoe (lat:39.5624, long:120.5635),
then outputs the resulting fires to output_coordinates.txt.

There are a couple files you can use for reference:
- file_reading_demo.py shows you how to read from a file (reads from test.txt)
- example_output.txt shows the properly formatted answer
